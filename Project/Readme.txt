1.To Run the Nearest Neighbour Algorithm:

javac TspNearestNeib.java
java TspNearestNeib filename.txt

Output will be generated in a file named - TSP_output

2.To run the Modified Prims Algorithm
Compile : g++ main.cpp -o main
To run with a file on the command line do the following: main.exe filename.txt
it will output a file with the name filename.txt.tour

3.To Run the Dynamic Programming Algorithm:
javac TspDP1.java
java TspDP1 test-input-1.txt
